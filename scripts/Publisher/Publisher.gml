/// @func Publisher
/// @param {string} channels...	optional: If provided, will create channels with the given names.
/// @desc	Publishers are message processing backends.  Methods are bound to the channels, and called
//		with the supplied parameters when a channel is notified they belong to.  These methods are
//		called at the scope they are bound, which means they are run as if they were a part of the
//		subscribing instance.  Thus a single instance can subscribe to multiple channels, or even
//		the same channel multiple times if desired.
// >*NOTE: Publisher makes use of dynamic resources, and so should always be destroyed when no longer needed to prevent memory leaks which will slow down and eventually crash your game.*
/// @example
//var _achievement	= new Publisher()
//
//_publisher.subscriber_add( "kills", function( _number ) {

//  if ( global.kills_progress > 1000 ) {
//    steam_set_achievement("kills1000");
