/// @func include
/// @param {int}	object_index	The object to inject the current event from.
/// @desc Will run the current event from `object_index`.  For example, if called during the step event,
//this would inject the step event from the given object into the current code.  This allows you to treat
//objects like components, and share their code easily without relying on inheritance.
/// @example
//include( oInclude );

function include( _object ){
