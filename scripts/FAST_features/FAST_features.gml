// Provides a global channel pub/sub framework for message distribution. You can safely comment this code

// it has not been done during startup.

// Handles the creation and management of Logger objects. You can safely comment this code out, the
// manager will be instantiated on-demand if a new Logger is created or a log_ function is called.

// Provides extra rendering features such as automatic resolution scaling.  You can safely comment this code
// out, and the manager simply will not instantiate.  Calling RenderManager() later will attempt to instantiate
// it during gameplay but it is best to do it before the game begins.  Additionally, while the FASTRender
// object is expected, it can be inherited and extended, or even outright replaced here.
//	related functions: none
