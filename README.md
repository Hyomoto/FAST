FAST is a modular library that provides easy-to-use tools to get GMS developers away from boilerplate tasks and onto building their games. There is no genre-specific code or implementation found here. Instead, FAST focuses powerful, common-use tools that provide general utility to fill the gaps in GML functions and tedious framework tasks. The Core library offers up publisher, event and file frameworks, while modules extend it into more specific tasks such as input handling and resolution scaling, or power-user features such as scripting and databases. In short, FAST can work with every game, and compliment any game made with GMS2.3 or later.

<h3>
How do I import FAST into my project?
</h3>
From the Releases tab for this repo, download the .yymps file for the latest version. There are two release packages: the full package and core. Core contains only FAST Core for users who want only the basic features. Once downloaded, load up your project in the GMS2.3 IDE. Click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu, then import FAST and add all. FAST is self-configuring, and only requires input for the features you wish to use.
