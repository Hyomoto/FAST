GML is a simple language with many built-in features that make it accessible to new and advanced users. However, some tasks are unexpectedly tricky or complex. FAST is a lightweight library that provides easy-to-use tools that empower developers to focus on building their game. There is no genre-specific code or implementation found here. Instead, FAST focuses powerful, common-use tools that provide general utility to the language rather than box it in. In short, FAST can work with any game, and should compliment every game made with GMS2.3 or later.

### How do I import FAST into my project?
GameMaker Studio 2.3+ allows importing assets, including scripts and shaders, directly into a project via the "Local Package" system. From the Releases tab for this repo, download the .yymps file for the latest version. In the GMS2 IDE, load up your project and click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu then import all scripts from the package.
