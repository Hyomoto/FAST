FAST is a lightweight library that provides easy-to-use tools to make it easy for GMS developers to focus on building their game. There is no genre-specific code or implementation found here. Instead, FAST focuses powerful, common-use tools that provide general utility to fill the gaps in GML functions and handle boilerplate taks. There are modules for common tasks like input and file handling, as well as power-user features such as scripting and databases. FAST is non-intrusive, can work with any game, and should compliment every game made with GMS2.3 or later.

<h3>
How do I import FAST into my project?
</h3>
From the Releases tab for this repo, download the .yymps file for the latest version. There are two release packages: the full package and core. Core contains only FAST Core for users who want only the basic features. Once downloaded, load up your project in the GMS2.3 IDE. Click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu, then import FAST and add all. FAST is self-configuring, and only requires input for the features you wish to use.
