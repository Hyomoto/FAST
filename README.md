FAST is a lightweight library that provides easy-to-use tools to make it easy for GMS developers to focus on building their game. There is no genre-specific code or implementation found here. Instead, FAST focuses powerful, common-use tools that provide general utility to fill the gaps in GML functions and handle boilerplate taks. There are modules for common tasks like input and file handling, as well as power-user features such as scripting and databases. FAST is non-intrusive, can work with any game, and should compliment every game made with GMS2.3 or later.

<h3>
How do I import FAST into my project?
</h3>
GameMaker Studio 2.3+ allows importing assets, including scripts and shaders, directly into a project via the "Local Package" system. From the Releases tab for this repo, download the .yymps file for the latest version. In the GMS2 IDE, load up your project and click on "Tools" on the main window toolbar. Select "Import Local Package" from the drop-down menu then import all scripts from the package.  FAST is self-configuring, and only requires input for the features you wish to use.
