2.5 is a huge stability and clean-up release aimed at making FAST easier to approach and more immediately
useful. This includes the removal of a number of data structures that are now redundant, slimming down
of Core by pushing out modules absorbed in previous updates, and proper documentation of every component.

# New Features
* Errors - FAST will now throw useful errors when data structures or functions are used improperly.  These errors
	can be tested for and caught easily.
* Struct Parentage - Structs can inherit from __Struct__ and make use of the new __Type__.add function to
	easily test for type.  is_struct_of has been replaced with struct_type, which will test against
	type if it exists, otherwise it will perform a basic string match using instanceof()
* Iterable Lists - Array and DsLinked list now inherit from the __IterableList__ type which will wrap up
	both data types with the same feature set.  This includes set rules such as union, intersect and
	difference, sorting, filtering, shuffling, have built-in JSON export/import, and are garbage collected.
* Dictionary - A simple replacement for ds_map that is also garbage collected and also provides built-in
	convenience features.
	
# Updated
* Surface - update_set() will now also set the surface if update would return true. draw will also reset
	the surface if it is the current target. resize with throw errors if invalid arguments are provided.


# Changes
* Logging moved out of Core. syslog and __GenericOutput__ are still part of core.  However, FAST no longer
	makes use of the logging module internally.
* Publisher moved out of Core.
* File Handling moved out of Core.
* Array now makes use of __IterableList__ and uses a different feature set.  Other than depreciated
	structures this is likely the largest change.
	
# Depreciated, and replacement
* DsChain - redundant, no replacement
* DsLinkedList - LinkedList
* DsList - LinkedList
* DsMap - Dictionary
* DsQueue - LinkedList
* DsStack - LinkedList
* DsTable - never worked, Dictionary is closest replacement
* DsWalkable - LinkedList
* DsTree - will reworked and re-added, for now use legacy but is no longer supported
* String - redundant, no replacement
* StringNumber - no replacement
* StringTime - time_to_string now provides the same output
