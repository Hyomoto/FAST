# Revision h

Renamed [ArrayDynamic -> ArrayList](https://github.com/Hyomoto/FASTv33/wiki/Array)
* This also renames append() to add() to make it more internally consistent with other data structures.

Split [Gamepad](https://github.com/Hyomoto/FASTv33/wiki/Input-Handling-(3.3)#gamepad)
* Gamepad is now generic and contains no bound inputs, GamepadXbox and GamepadPlaystation are the pre-configured versions. There is no functionality changes here, this just simply provides a generic template that matches the controller in question.

Renamed Scripts -> Structs
* Previously all structs were in folders labeled Scripts. This was confusing, so now they are named Structs.

Merged File Handling and Logger into Core
* Originally the were separated out in the name of making FAST more modular, but they are core features.  Logging relies on File Handling, and all modules use Logging.

# RC3

FileCSV
* Added FileCSV as a file type.

DsChain
* Added copy implementation to make cloning data structures easier.

DsLinkedList, DsQueue, DsStack, DsWalkable
